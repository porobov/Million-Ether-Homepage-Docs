TheMillionEtherHomepage.com is just one of possible representations of the contract sitting in the blockchain. As the contract code is open anybody can develop a representation of their own. 

Here are few ideas: 

	- Bitcoin gateway
	- Users tree visualization
	- Sign in by email
	- Ads stream instead of 1000x1000 px field
	- Lending pixels
	- Exchange (landlord contacts and pixel prices)

All contract information is readable through public functions and events. Please see the contract for details.
