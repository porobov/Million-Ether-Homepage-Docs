WHITE PAPER
===========

**TheMillionEtherHomepage.com** is a decentralized advertising platform based on the blockchain technology.

Main features
-------------

1. 1000Ñ…1000 pixels field. 
2. Pixels may be bought, sold or used to place ads. 
3. Income is decentralized and shared between referrals (and charity). 

Interaction with the platform is done through **MillionEther smart contract** sitting in the Ethereum blockchain. Which means there is no need to trust anybody as the contract code is open. TheMillionEtherHomepage.com is just the representation of what is happening in the smart contract.

Buying pixels
-------------
Pixels are available in 10x10 pixel blocks. Once you buy a block (or blocks), you may put an ad (image with a link and description) within that block (or blocks) or decide to sell it later.

Selling pixels (Investment  opportunity)
----------------------------------------
The initial purchase price doubles with every 100 000 pixels sold. If you buy pixels early you can have significant profit selling them later (no fees here). All you have to do is set your price.

:ref:`How to sell pixels <sell>`

Placing ads
-----------
An ad is an image with description and a link to your website. The minimum image size is 10x10 pixels. You can place as many images as you can fit within owned area. You can also replace images unlimited number of times. Description is 140 characters long.

*The fee for placing ads is currently set to 0. Please note that the smart contract administrator is allowed to set this fee if needed in the future (as it requires off chain computations to push images to the website). For details see* :ref:`Admin privileges <admin>`

*Please read the rules for images allowed on the platform:* :ref:`Advertising policies <policies>`

Pixel price
-----------
The pixel price doubles with every 100 000 pixels sold. This allows investment opportunities and rewards early birds.

.. _activation:

User activation time
--------------------
With every handshake far from the Root (Admin) user activation time increases by 2 being 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 hours and so on. We encourage shorter (and faster) chains to increase charity donations, project support and referrals incomes (by preventing  one user with many accounts filling up the whole referral chain and get all the  income). 

We believe it also brings us closer to our side goal - the small world experiment on blockchain. `More on the small world experiment <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_experiment/>`_
