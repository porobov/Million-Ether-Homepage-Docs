Buying pixels
-------------
Pixels are available in 10x10 pixel blocks at initial sale (USD price doubles every 10% of pixels sold). Pixels are also available from owners willing to sell. Owners define their own price in ETH. Once you buy an area of blocks, you can put an ad (image with a link and description) within that area, rent it out or sell it when the price goes up.

*The pixel price doubles every 10% of pixels sold. This allows investment opportunities and rewards early birds.*

Selling pixels
--------------
If you own an area you can sell it for any price (in ETH). If you buy pixels early you can have significant profit selling them later with no fees applied.

Renting out pixels
------------------
If you own an area you can rent it out for any price per period (in ETH). One period is 24 hours. Renters will be able to place (and replace) their ads within rented area.

Renting pixels
--------------
